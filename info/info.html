            <h2>Game Overview</h2>
            <p>BLACKBOX is a fun, interactive game where players guess the most popular answers to subjective questions, based on a survey filled out by all participants. The game involves physical movement as players stand in different squares based on their guesses, adding an element of activity and fun.</p>

            <h2>How to Play</h2>
            <p>To play BLACKBOX, start by gathering all the players in a room where you have set up a projector or a large screen. The game revolves around a series of fun, subjective questions like "Who will be the richest later?" or "Who is the most likely to become a celebrity?" Each round follows these steps:</p>
            <p><strong>1. Question Display:</strong> The game will display a question on the screen. After a few seconds, three names will appear in separate rectangles. These names represent the top three most voted people for that question, but their positions are randomized.</p>
            <p><strong>2. Making Your Guess:</strong> Each player must decide which of the three names they believe received the most votes. Players then move to stand in one of the three designated squares in the room, each corresponding to one of the names displayed on the screen. A countdown timer appears on the screen, giving players a limited amount of time to make their decision and move to their chosen square.</p>
            <p><strong>3. Revealing the Winner:</strong> When the timer reaches zero, the rectangle of the person who received the most votes turns green, revealing the winner of that round. Players standing in the square of the winning person can then give out sips to other players, who must take a drink.</p>
            <p><strong>4. Proceed to Next Question:</strong> After the winner is revealed and sips are given out, the game prompts you to proceed to the next question. This process repeats for each question in the game.</p>
            <p>The aim of the game is to have fun, laugh with friends, and enjoy the playful competition. There's no scoring or overall winner; it's all about enjoying the experience together.</p>

            <h2>Setup Instructions for Organizers</h2>
            <p><strong>1. Create the Questions:</strong> Using Google Forms, create a survey with various fun and subjective questions like "Who is the most likely to become a celebrity?" Make sure each question is formatted as "Who is the most likely to...?" and provide a dropdown menu with the names of all participants to avoid spelling errors and ensure consistency.</p>
            <p><strong>2. Distribute the Survey:</strong> Send the Google Forms survey to all participants, asking them to answer each question anonymously by selecting a name from the dropdown menu.</p>
            <p><strong>3. Collect Responses:</strong> Wait for all participants to submit their responses. It's crucial that the organizers do not look at the answers to avoid spoiling the game for themselves.</p>
            <p><strong>4. Prepare the Game Environment:</strong> Set up a projector or large screen to display the game. Designate three squares in the room where the game will be played. These squares will correspond to the three choices shown on the screen during each round.</p>
            <p><strong>5. Load the Game:</strong> Use the collected survey data to load the game. Make sure the game is ready to display questions and choices in the proper format.</p>
            <p>By following these steps, you will ensure that BLACKBOX is set up correctly and ready for everyone to enjoy.</p>
